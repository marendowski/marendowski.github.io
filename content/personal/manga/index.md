|  Title  |  Genre  |  Description  |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
[20th Century Boys](https://myanimelist.net/manga/3/20th_Century_Boys) | Historical, Psychological | The best work of Naoki Urasawa. My favourite manga. Is engaging, thrilling and well-thought.
[Vagabond](https://myanimelist.net/manga/656/Vagabond) | Historical, Samurai | Really good, but there is no ending.
[Golden Kamuy](https://myanimelist.net/manga/85968/Golden_Kamuy) | Action, Adventure, Historical, Military | After reading this I'm an expert in [Ainu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people) culture and Asian history of 1900s. Perfect for someone who likes history.
[Berserk](https://myanimelist.net/manga/2/Berserk?q=berserk&cat=manga) | Gore, Military, Mythology, Psychological | Almost as good as 20th Century Boys. You can feel the adventure and enjoy this dark fantasy.
[Black Lagoon](https://myanimelist.net/manga/735/Black_Lagoon?q=black%20lagoon&cat=manga) | Adult Cast, Military, Organized Crime | Really good, I hope there will be more.
[Solo Leveling](https://myanimelist.net/manga/121496/Solo_Leveling) | Action, Adventure, Fantasy | The only manhwa I have read, really good.
