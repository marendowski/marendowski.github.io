|  Title  |  Genre  |  Description  |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
[Cowboy Bebop](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1/Cowboy_Bebop) | Bounty Hunters in space + 10 others | My favourite anime, watched it multiple times, sometimes is very funny and fast, but sometimes is really slow and serious. The English dub is awesome also. There are a lot of genres mixed in it.
[Steins Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate) | Time travel | Really well-thought and interesting.
[Bleach](https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach) | Shounen | The longest and the best Shounen I have watched (watched around 2 or 3 of them so). I don't think that I'll watch another Shounen soon.
[Princess Mononoke](https://myanimelist.net/anime/164/Mononoke_Hime) | Fantasy, Action, Adventure, Ghibli | The best Ghibli movie for me. Sends a message about destruction and nature.
[Black Lagoon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/889/Black_Lagoon) | Crime, Gangsters | Surprisingly fun and over-the-top.
[Code Geass](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1575/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch) | Mecha, Military | A lot of plot twists with thinking and politics.
[Kill la Kill](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18679/Kill_la_Kill) | Action, Comedy, Fantasy, Ecchi | Classic Trigger over-the-top, action-packed anime with beautiful and atypical animation.
[Initial D](https://myanimelist.net/anime/185/Initial_D_First_Stage) | Racing | I'm not a car fan, but was really good (except for the romance part) and sometimes even a bit tense.
[Mushoku Tensei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39535/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu) | Isekai, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy | I don't like nor watch isekai, but this is really good and I'm waiting for more.
[Cyberpunk Edgerunners](https://myanimelist.net/anime/42310/Cyberpunk__Edgerunners) | Cyberpunk | Trigger again with a banger, this time based on the Cyberpunk 2077.
[Love is War](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37999/Kaguya-sama_wa_Kokurasetai__Tensai-tachi_no_Renai_Zunousen) | Romance, Comedy | The best rom-com out there, is unlike other rom-coms I have watched.
[Monster](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster) | Thriller, Psychological | The second best work of Naoki Urasawa. Is intense and chilling.
[Evangelion](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Shinseiki_Evangelion) | Mecha, Psychological | Everyone needs to watch Evangelion.
[Samurai Champloo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/205/Samurai_Champloo) | Action, Adventure, Comedy | From the Cowboy Bebop director. Where history and cool fights mix with what was to become a lofi hip-hop.
[Konosuba](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo) | Isekai, Comedy | Super fun to watch, guilty pleasure.
[Attack on Titan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin) | Military, Titans | Do I need to write something?

## Western "anime"

Feels like anime, but apparently was made in the west.

|  Title  |  Genre  |  Description  |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
[Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) | Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy | One of the best "anime" I've watched. An epic adventure, fun and meaningful.
[Samurai Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Jack) | Action, Adventure, Drama, Dystopian science fantasy | Beautiful animation, action-packed series. Really worth watching even for the last season only.
