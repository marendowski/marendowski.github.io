## About

These are my little toy projects that I created in order to learn specific framework or toolkit:
* [An example usage of Qt Quick map inside a Qt Widgets program](https://github.com/marendowski/Qt-Widgets-QML-Map)
* [Xlib library examples](https://github.com/marendowski/xlib)
* [My solutions from "Java Programming" (part 1 and 2) offered on mooc.fi (2023) ](https://github.com/marendowski/java-mooc.fi)
* [My C exercises and projects from K.N. King's "C Programming: A Modern Approach 2nd Edition"](https://github.com/marendowski/knking-c-solutions)
